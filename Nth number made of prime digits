QUESTION: Nth number made of prime digits 

Given a number 'N'. The task is to find the Nth number whose each digit is a prime number i.e 2, 3, 5, 7. In other words you have to find nth number of this sequence : 2, 3, 5, 7, 22, 23 ,.. and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 33
Explanation:10th number in the sequence of
numbers whose each digit is prime is 33.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 21
Output: 222
Explanation:21st number in the sequence of
numbers whose each digit is prime is 222.
Your Task:
Complete primeDigits function and return the nth number of the given sequence made of prime digits.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100 

SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find nth number made of only prime digits.
    int primeDigits(int n)
    {
        //code here
        vector<int> v;
       v.push_back(2),v.push_back(3),v.push_back(5),v.push_back(7);
       int i=22;
       while(v.size()<101)
       {
           int p=i;

            while(p%10>0)
            {
               int k=p%10;
               if(k==2 || k==3 || k==5 || k==7)
               p = p/10;
               else
               break;
           }
           if(p==0) v.push_back(i);
           i++;
       }
       return v[n-1];
    }
};
