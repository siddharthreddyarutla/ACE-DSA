QUESTION: Hashing for pair - 2

You are given an array of integers and an integer sum. You need to find if two numbers in the array exists that have sum equal to the given sum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
sum = 14

Output: 
1

Explanation: 
there exists a pair which 
gives sum as 14 example 
(4,10),(5,9) etc.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] ={4, 3, 5, 6}
sum = 12

Output: 
0

Explanation: 
there does not exist any
such pair which gives sum as 12.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You just have to complete the function sumExists() which takes the array arr[], its size N and an integer sum as inputs and returns 1 if there exists a pair with the given sum in the array. Else, it returns 0. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= arri <= 106
1 <= sum <= 1000

SOLUTION:

int sumExists(int arr[], int N, int sum) 
{
    // Your code here
    sort(arr,arr+N);
    
    int i=0;
    int j=N-1;
    while(i<j)
    {
        if(arr[i]+arr[j]==sum)
        {
            return true;
        }
        else if(arr[i]+arr[j]<sum)
        {
            i++;
        }
        else
        {
            j--;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
