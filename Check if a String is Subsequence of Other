QUESTION;  Check if a String is Subsequence of Other

Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


Example 1:

Input:
A = AXY 
B = YADXCP
Output: 0 
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B
as 'Y' appears before 'A'.

Example 2:

Input:
A = gksrek
B = geeksforgeeks
Output: 1
Explanation: A is a subsequence of B.
 

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isSubSequence() which takes A and B as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if A is a subsequence of B or not. 

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is length of string B.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1<= |A|,|B| <=106

SOLUTION:

bool isSubSequence(string A, string B)
    {
        //code here
        int n=B.length();
        int m=A.length();
        if(n<m)
        return false;
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(A[j]==B[i])
            {
                j++;
            }
        }
        if(j==m)
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
