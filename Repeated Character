QUESTION: Repeated Character 

Given a string consisting of lowercase english alphabets. Find the repeated character present first in the string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: g
Explanation: g, e, k and s are the repeating
characters. Out of these, g occurs first. 
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abcde"
Output: -1
Explanation: No repeating character present.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function firstRep() which takes the string S as input and returns the the first repeating character in the string. In case there's no repeating character present, return '#'.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105

SOLUTION:

char firstRep (string s)
    {
        //code here.
        int count[256]={0};
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            count[s[i]-'a']++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            if(count[s[i]-'a']>1)
            {
                return s[i];
            }
        }
        return '#';
    }
