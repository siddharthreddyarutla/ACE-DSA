QUESTION: Check if a string is Isogram or not

Given a string S of lowercase alphabets, check if it is isogram or not. An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Example 1:

Input:
S = machine
Output: 1
Explanation: machine is an isogram
as no letter has appeared twice. Hence
we print 1.
Example 2:

Input:
S = geeks
Output: 0
Explanation: geeks is not an isogram
as 'e' appears twice. Hence we print 0.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function isIsogram() that takes a string as a parameter and returns either true or false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of distinct characters).
Note: N = |S|

Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 103

SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to check if a string is Isogram or not.
    bool isIsogram(string s)
    {
        //Your code here
        unordered_map<char,int> mp;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            mp[s[i]]++;
        }
        for(auto x:mp)
        {
            if(x.second>1)
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
